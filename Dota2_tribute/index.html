          <p style="color: orange" id="que1"><strong>What is Dota 2</strong></p>
          <p id="introduction">Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. The game is the stand-alone sequel to Defense of the ancients (Dota), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Due to the basal limitation of Warcraft III for balancing the Dota map, the map developers have set up a new version--Dota 2 with Valve. It's almost 100% the same as Dota for users, but much more flexible for developers. <br/><br/>Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams that consist of five players, with both teams occupying their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently control a powerful character, known as a "hero", that each feature unique abilities and different styles of play. During a match, a player and their team collects experience points and items for their heroes in order to fight through the opposing team's defenses. A team wins by being the first to destroy a large structure located in the opposing team's base, called the "Ancient".</p>
